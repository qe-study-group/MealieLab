# On Becoming a technical tester

As a tester, you span two worlds -- the world of business requirements and the world of software engineering. 

By improving your technical skills you will be able to:

* Add value by finding bugs that are not easily found by just testing via the user interface.
* Provide developers with additional information that will help them debug faster.
* Enjoy your work more due to increased understanding of all layers of the system.
* Build rapport with developers by sharing a common understanding and technical language.

## Technical Skills Covered

* Linux Command Line
* Containers (Docker)
* REST API
* SQL
* CI/CD

## Tools

* GitHub Codespaces
* VSCode IDE (comes with Codespaces)
* Docker and docker compose
* Postman
* Postgres
* pgAdmin
* GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
